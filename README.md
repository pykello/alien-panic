# Alien Panic

Alien Panic is a game similar to [Space Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Panic)  written in [Elm language](http://elm-lang.org/). I developed this game as another step in learning Elm and functional programming.

# Building

First, install Elm using the instructions found [here](http://elm-lang.org/install).

Then, run the following command to generate a HTML file which implements Alien Panic:

```
elm make alien-panic.elm --output=alien-panic.html
```

You can open ```alien-panic.html``` in your browser and see the output.
